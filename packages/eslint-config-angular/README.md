## ESlint for Angular

https://github.com/angular-eslint/

> Quite simply, this enables all the possible rules from @angular-eslint/eslint-plugin.

> It is strongly encouraged to combine the recommended Angular rules with the recommended configs from typescript-eslint (https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/#recommended-configurations), and this is what our schematics will generate for you automatically.
